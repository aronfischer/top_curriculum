### Project: Memory Card

And here we go with a new project again. Let's make sure you understood the concepts so far. The main goal of this project should be to use hooks or lifecycle methods as well as a lot of state. The idea for this project comes from [this](https://www.golangprograms.com/react-js-projects-for-beginners.html) site. It's a great ressource for project ideas.

### How the game works

Go play a round [here](http://demo7.downloader.tech/) to find out for yourself. You don't have to use celebreties, you can use anything you want.

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">
1. Create a new project using `create-react-app`
2. Take a little bit of time and think about how you want to implment your application. Which features you want to have in it, which components do you need, and how to structure your application. Your application should include at least a score board, which counts the current score, as well as a "best score", which shows the best score you achieved so far. Of course you also need a couple of cards, which display images, and maybe a short info text. There should also be a function that displays the cards in a random order, anytime a user clicks onto one. Make sure to also invoke that function when the component mounts.
3. So now that you thought about the structure of your application set up the folder structure and start creating the components. I suggest you use functional components and therefore hooks in this project.
4. Style your application a little bit, in order to be able to show it off.
5. Push the project to GitHub
