## Project: Shopping Chart

Now we are getting to our final React application. It's going to be a shopping chart.
This application should also have more than one route, at least two to give you a chance to make some use of your react-router-dom skills.

### Assignment

1. Create a new project with `create-react-app` and get rid of the boilerplate as in the previous projects
2. Think about the component and the folder structure. How could you set up your application? Which components or functionalities do you need?
3. You should at least have two pages (a homepage and a shop page, which includes your shopping chart) Let a user navigate between the pages with a navigation bar, which will be shown on both routes.
4. To your homepage you can add whatever you prefere. Some images or information will be totally fine. The main part of the project should be the shopping chart. The homepage is really just there to practice some routing, using `react-router-dom`
5. On your shopping chart route, a user should see a sticky bar (can be just a top section as well), which displayes the amount of items currently in chart. And you should also have a button next to it, where you could go to the chart to check out and pay (however we are not going to implement this logic here).
6. Build individual card items for each of your products. And display an input field on it, which let's a user type in manually how many items he or she wants to buy. Also add an icrement and decrement button next to it for fine tuning. You can also display a title for each product as well as an "add to chart" button.
7. Once a user submitted his order, the amount on the chart itself should adjust
8. Style your application a little bit, in order to be able to show it off.
9. Push the project to GitHub
